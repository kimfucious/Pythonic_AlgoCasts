# Print out the nth entry in the fibonacci series. The fibonacci series is an
# ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two.
# For example, the sequence, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] forms the first
# ten entries of the fibonacci series.
# Example:
#   fib(4) # returns 3


def fib(n):
    pass
