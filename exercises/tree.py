# --- Directions
# 1) Create a node class.  The __init__() method should accept an argument that
#    gets assigned to the "data" data attribute and initialize an empty list for
#    storing children. The node class should have methods 'add' and 'remove'.
# 2) Create a tree class. The tree should initialize a 'root' data attribute
#    with the initial value of None.
# 3) Implement 'traverseBF' and 'traverseDF' on the tree class.  Each method
#    should accept a function that gets called with each element in the tree


class Node:
    pass


class Tree:
    pass
